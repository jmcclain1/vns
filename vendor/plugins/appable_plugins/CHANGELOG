* Add more tests to verify mixing of classes in namespaces

* No longer assume that all directories under app are mixable.  This can especially cause issues if it finds a views directory.

* Simplify method for determining namespaces

* Fix not mixing namespaced classes correctly when defined in both the plugin and the application

*0.1.0* (March 31st, 2007)

* Don't add app/* paths to Dependencies.load_once_paths.  Closes #7

* Add default support for app/services/*_service.rb paths

* No longer deals directory with Rails::Initializer.load_plugin, instead moving all initialization code to the Plugin class

* Added default support for app/apis/*_api.rb paths

* Added better support for injecting dependencies for plugins when being loaded midway through initialization

* Smarter location of app paths in $LOAD_PATH, Dependencies.load_paths, and Dependencies.load_once_paths. [Brian Takita]

* Refactor appable_plugins.rb into files for each individual class being extended. #12 [Brian Takita]

* Fix loading the incorrect files when the path given in require/load is absolute.  Closes #11

* Support running tests with plugins loaded via edge pluginaweek.  #10 [Brian Takita]

* Properly load plugins once Rails has been initialized

* Updated to use the new Plugin interface

* No longer caches all files immediately upon initialization

* Code-mixing is much more paranoid now, making sure that if a file like "actor.rb" is being loaded, that file is really a model

* Fixes loading files in the incorrect order when using plugin dependencies

* Added empty files so that test directories get added to the gem

*0.0.2* (February 2nd, 2007)

* Paths no longer end in / to remain consistent with Rails conventions

* Files are now loaded in the correct order for plugins that were loaded as dependencies

* The location of new folders in the LOAD_PATH is now based on the current location of the app's lib folder

*0.0.1* (November 14th, 2006)

* Initial release
