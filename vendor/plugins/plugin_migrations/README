= plugin_migrations

plugin_migrations adds the ability for all plugins to have the same migration
capabilities that your Rails application has.

== How it works

In addition to the normal schema_info table that Rails created in your database
to keep track of the current migration version, this plugin adds a new table
called plugin_schema_info:

  plugin_schema_info
  ------------------
  plugin_name (string)
  version (integer)

Plugin migrations expects the migrations to be located in a similar directory
structure as that of your Rails application. That is, it would look in
/db/migrations in your plugin's folder.

== Usage

The plugin can be used via the new rake tasks that have been added.  The plugins
which are migrated are based on what is stored in $LOADED_PLUGINS.  For more
information on the variable, see the loaded_plugins plugin at
http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Loaded_plugins.

=== db:migrate:plugins

Running db:migrate:plugins will run the migrations for every plugin that is
loaded.  You can also specify exactly which plugin you want to migrate.

Examples:

Assuming the following directory structure:

  vendor/
  vendor/plugins/
  vendor/plugins/acts_as_bunny
  vendor/plugins/acts_as_as_chicken

  rake db:migrate:plugins # Migrates both acts_as_bunny and acts_as_chicken
  rake db:migrate:plugins PLUGIN=acts_as_bunny
  rake db:migrate:plugins PLUGIN=acts_as_bunny VERSION=2

=== db:fixtures:load:plugins

Running db:fixtures:load:plugins will load the fixtures for every plugin that is
loaded.  You can also specify exactly which plugin you want to load fixtures for.

Examples:

Assuming the following directory structure:

  vendor/
  vendor/plugins/
  vendor/plugins/acts_as_bunny
  vendor/plugins/acts_as_as_chicken

  rake db:fixtures:load:plugins # Loads fixtures for both acts_as_bunny and acts_as_chicken
  rake db:fixtures:load:plugins PLUGIN=acts_as_bunny
  rake db:fixtures:load:plugins PLUGIN=acts_as_bunny FIXTURES=bunnies
  rake db:fixtures:load:plugins PLUGIN=acts_as_bunny FIXTURES=bunnies,rabbits

== Dependencies

This plugin dependencies on the presence of the following plugins:
* loaded_plugins - http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Loaded_plugins
* plugin_dependencies - http://wiki.pluginaweek.org/Plugin_dependencies (only if being installed as a plugin)

Thanks to James Adam and his Engines plugin for providing an implementation
upon which this plugin is based (http://www.rails-engines.org/).
