== Usage

During initialization, Rails.plugins will keep track of a list of all of the
plugins that have been loaded so far.  Once initialization is complete,
Rails.plugins will contain all of the plugins loaded in the application.

The order of the plugins will be based on the order in which the plugins were
loaded during initialization.

== Caveats

If you need access to Rails.plugins during initialization of your application,
you must use require_plugin from the plugin_dependencies plugin or ensure that
loaded_plugins is loaded before your plugin.  Otherwise, if you load it during
initialization with the following:

  require 'loaded_plugins'

This will not track all of the plugins that were loaded prior to it being
required until AFTER initialization is complete.

Also, note that the plugins are listed in the order that they are +completely+
loaded.  That is, only after the entire initialization of a plugin is complete
will it get added to Rails.plugins.

This plugin has been heavily influenced by the work James Adam has done in
Engines 1.2 (http://www.rails-engines.org/).
